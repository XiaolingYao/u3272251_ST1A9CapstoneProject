# u3272251_ST1A9CapstoneProject
StudentID: u3272251; This is for the ST1 Assignment 9 CapstoneProject

This project is based on the Diamond data available from Kaggle repositor (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivam2503/diamonds/data)

My project task is to create a machine learning model which can predict the price of the diamond based on its characteristics.
For solving this problem, I will follow a step by step approach to create a data analysis and prediction model based on machine learning/AI algorithms, regression algorithms available from different Python packages, modules and classes.

It'll be based on python, including google colab data analysis and machine learning report (.ipynb), then exported the model (as .pkl file), and the Tkinter included python files (.py) which are more suitable for the local environment.
